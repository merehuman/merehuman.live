☆queer gaming!!!☆<br>
recently, i have started collaboratively organizing a queer gaming group in new york that plays & corresponds about games made by QTIPOC. we're working on a list of game designers & games that we love & want to experience together, which i have included below. please email me if you want to play with us/help organize or have anything to contribute to our archiving<3

<br><br>
★<a href="http://neveralonegame.com/">never alone</a> is a game i've been wanting to play that was made by and about the Iñupiat people, an alaskan indigenous community. this game has recieved very disparate reviews & has had a lot of critical engagement from the games community and the academic community. <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/jodi-a-byrd-video-games-indigeneity-settler-colonialism">jodi byrd discusses here</a>.
