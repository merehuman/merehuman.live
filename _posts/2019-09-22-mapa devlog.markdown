this is a link to the development log of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MapaVR/">MapaVR</a> project.<br><br>
the project is a collaboration between david carrasco, laana carrasco, stewart bird, and jessa gillespie.

the mapa de cuauhtinchan is an artifact from the ~1540s that holds the memory of an indigenous community in early colonial mexico. this map was created just two decades after the aztecs were violently overthrown by spanish colonizers, and it follows the emergence of ancestors from chicomoztoc, their migration to cholula, and ultimately their settlement of cuauhtinchan.<br>
david carrasco, a professor of the study of latin america at harvard divinty school has culminated his decades long research of this map into the publication: cave, city, and eagle's nest.<br>

as a team, we are developing a virtual reality experience of this map as a means of preserving this indigenous communities narrative across various platforms. wnet is simultaneously producing a documentary surrounding this research, and the map.
